# Pong.cpp

A pong clone made using C++ and SDL Library.
In order to learn video games programming using C++, I decided to program some simple Arcade games, Pong is the first one and many more to come.

## Requirements
For Windows to run this game you need [MinGW](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Mingw) installed. Just clone the repo and type `mingw32-make.exe` and run `pong.exe`.

## Controls
&#8593 arrow to go up  <br />
&#8595 arrow to go down  <br />
&#80; to pause the game  <br />
î€› to exit the game  <br />
